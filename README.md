Portfolio for Robin Hansson


Background
----------------------------------
SVG illustrations with parallax effect using Skrollr.js.
The SVG is used instead of PNG images to reduce filesize and smooth up 
the browser rendering during scroll. Parallax effect works on mobile (with some link issues). You can find the site [here](Arthcy http://www.arthcy.net)
